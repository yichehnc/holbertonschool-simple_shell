NAME
	shell - a simple command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system, which allows users to type in commands and receive outputs.

SYNOPSIS
	shell

DESCRIPTION

	Simple Shell is a major project at Holberton School first sprint in which we build a working simple shell program.

	In interactive mode, simple_shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command. The prompt is displayed again after each command execution.

	In non-interactive mode, simple_shell reads commands from standard input or a file and executes them.


COMPILATION
	shell can be compiled using the following command:

	$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell
